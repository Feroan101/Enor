# Enor

Enor is a small, *low-level programming language*.
It’s designed to be simple, explicit, and run on its own virtual machine.

## Cradle

Cradle is the *virtual machine* Enor runs on.
It executes Enor bytecode and defines the runtime model.

## Status

*Still in development*.
Things will evolve as the VM matures.
