ip determines the jump in inst, hence its possible to move it as long as one instruction byte
everything below sp is revelant, above that is *garbage value*

sp - stack pointer
ip - instruction pointer 
pm - pointer memory

Program memory:
    read-only byte array
    indexed by ip

Stack:
    integer values
    last-in-first-out
    grows dynamically

Instruction pointer(ip):
    points to next opcode byte
    always valid or execution halts

Execution loop
    fetch opcode
    decode instruction width
    execute
    advance ip
